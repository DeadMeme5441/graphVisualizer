1.  [50,000 feet overview]
	-File Creation/File Uploading
	-Dashboard with dynamic graphs and interchangable values containing Table, Regression Plot, Time Series Plot, Jointplot, Pairplot and Correlation plot.
	-Benchmarking tool to clean data and generate most efficient models using ranking methods (Filter,Wrapper,Elimination)
	-Results page with Regression Model Statistics(IPMVP), Predicted vs Observed Graph, Monthly Bias, Confidence Interval.
	-Export Generated data in pdf or save to database.
2.  [Blocks of the Project]
	-Frontend UI for the user -> Frontend
	-Backend API configured for ML calculations and serving frontend -> Backend
	-Database + Storing -> Database
3.  [Backend Server]
	a. [Routes]
		-Functionality
			i. Accept File only if file has .csv extension
			ii. 
			iv. Create another array with 2nd and x column if user requires it and generate data graphs based on the array; x is new column selected
			v. Calculate Ranked Regression Models based on filters selected
		-API Routes 
			i. /api/uploadfile (dashboard)
			ii. /api/benchmark
			iii. /api/results		
	b. [Functions]
		- Reading of csv data on upload
		- Read by default 2nd and 3rd column and write onto 2 arrays
		-Generation of Regression, Time Series, Joint, Pair, Correlation plot on dashboard based on array
		-Generation of IPMVP, Predicted vs Observed, Monthly Bias, Confidence Interval on results based on benchmark data
4.  [UI Components]
	-Directory Routes
		i. /Home
		ii. /Login
		iii. /CreateTable
		iv. /Dashboard
		v. /Benchmark
		vi. /Results
	-Functions
		i. Upload File with .csv extension
		ii. Displays dashboard with required data graphs
		iii. Adds another dashboard with required data graphs when selecting new dataset from .csv file
		iv. Bread Crumbs for site navigation
		v. Selection of Ranking method, Number of Model Selection, Number of Variables to generate Ranked Regression Models
		vi. Displays results dashboard with required data graphs
		vii. Parsing of all data into pdf to be printed 
		viii. Export all data into remote database

V3.0
Logic:

Home Page:
	Login: (requires IT to build, can delegate to IT)
		-Linked to Enova portal
		-uses LDAP authentication
	File Upload:
		-Uploads csv/excel files with values like y,CDD18,Footfall etc; Uploaded file will have datetime in 1st column, y in 2nd column, and rest
		-datetime is not used for calculations, but is shown alongside values that are used in graph generation
		-OnFileUpload,
		csv {
			y (2nd column) , cdd (3rd column) made into arrays and sent to backend
		}

Dashboard:
	-Contains Table, Regression Plot, Time Series Plot, Jointplot, Pairplot and Correlation plot.
	-Regression is dynamic i.e, Plots in graph can be deselected and regression re-generated from selected points
	-(Possible?) 2 Types of Correlation plot is made, one with colours and other values (see xd link)
